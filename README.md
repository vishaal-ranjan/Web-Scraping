# Web-Scraping

Here, I have made use of the BeautifulSoup library in order to scrape the following website: 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/' which is essentially made for scraping ethically. Here, the aim is to count the number of occurences of the tags which are associated with all the given quotes and then print all of them in the decreasing order of their frequency of occurence.
